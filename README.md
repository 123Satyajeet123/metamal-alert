Advanced Malware Detection Platform

Overview
The Metamal-D-Alert system is a comprehensive, AI-driven malware detection platform designed to analyze files using a combination of dynamic and static analysis techniques. It leverages modern deep learning models to provide accurate and efficient malware detection results. This project integrates a user-friendly frontend built with React.js, a robust backend powered by Node.js/Express.js, and a deep learning model deployed within Docker containers for consistent performance across environments.

Features
User Interface (UI): Developed with React.js to provide a responsive and interactive platform where users can upload files for analysis and view results.
Backend Server: Built with Node.js and Express.js to handle file uploads, communicate with the hybrid analysis API, and interact with the deep learning model.
Hybrid Analysis API: Combines dynamic and static analysis to generate a detailed JSON report, which the deep learning model processes to detect malware.
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a CNN-BiGRU model, enhanced by NLP embeddings, for accurate malware detection. Deployed using Docker for environment consistency.
Database: NoSQL database for storing analysis results and logs, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
System Architecture
The system is composed of several high-level components:

User Interface (UI): React.js
Backend Server: Node.js, Express.js
Hybrid Analysis API: Python-based custom API for dynamic and static analysis
Deep Learning Model: CNN-BiGRU with NLP embeddings, deployed in Docker
Database: MongoDB for storing results and logs

Implementation Details
Frontend: Implements a smooth drag-and-drop file upload experience using React Dropzone. Displays analysis results dynamically with React state management.
Backend: API integration handled through Node.js middleware, ensuring secure and efficient communication between the frontend, hybrid analysis API, and deep learning model.
Hybrid Analysis API: Executes files in a sandbox environment for dynamic analysis while performing static code inspection to provide a comprehensive threat assessment.
Deep Learning Model: The model is trained on a labeled dataset and fine-tuned with hyperparameter adjustments. It combines CNN for feature extraction and BiGRU for sequence analysis.
Performance Metrics
Accuracy: 98% on the test set.
Response Time: Average of 5 seconds for file analysis.
Scalability: Efficiently handles concurrent file uploads and analyses.
Testing
Unit Testing: Ensured individual components, such as file upload and API endpoints, function correctly.
Integration Testing: Verified seamless interaction between the frontend, backend, hybrid analysis API, and deep learning model.
Acceptance Testing: Conducted with end-users to validate overall system performance and usability.
